# Context-Aware Trace Aligner
The tool implements a techinique based in theoretic manipulations of deterministic finite state automata (DFAs) to build optimal alignments driven by dedicated cost models that assign context-dependent variable costs to the deviations.
The technique has been implemented relying on Automated Planning in Artificial Intelligence.
