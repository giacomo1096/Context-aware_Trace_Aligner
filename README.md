# Context-Aware Trace Aligner
## Description
The tool implements a technique based on theoretic manipulations of deterministic finite state automata (DFAs) to build optimal alignments driven by dedicated cost models that assign context-dependent variable costs to the deviations.
The technique has been implemented relying on Automated Planning in Artificial Intelligence.

## Hot to use the tool
The tool is known to work on Mac and Linux machines.
