# Context-Aware Trace Aligner
## Description
The tool implements a techinique based in theoretic manipulations of deterministic finite state automata (DFAs) to build optimal alignments driven by dedicated cost models that assign context-dependent variable costs to the deviations.
The technique has been implemented relying on Automated Planning in Artificial Intelligence.

We provide [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WVQYU1hdiKNJgzDeR2L7yTiiZIJekh_u/view?usp=sharing) a set of synthetic event logs and models to test the performance of the tool.
